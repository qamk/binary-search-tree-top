# Binary Search Tree
This program allows you to interact with a Binary Search Tree (BST). Like in the [linked list program](https://github.com/qamk/linked-list-top), there is an "interface" so to speak, where you can enter different commands to use the list.
However, this program also has *driver code* which, much like in the [recursion program](https://repl.it/@qamk/recursion-top#README.md) interacts with the BST on behalf of the user. Live version [here](https://repl.it/@qamk/binary-search-tree-top#README.md).

## Aim
Simple aim again, implement BST using OOP, ensuring that key functionality is present (insertion, deletion, traversal and so on).

## Tasks
So there were a few tasks, mostly optional set by me.
- [x] Create a BST using OOP with functionality as listed on TOP project page
- [x] (Optional) Add an interface so that the user can enter commands
  - [x] (Optional) Make it colourful!
- [x] (Optional) Add driver code
  - [x] (Optional) Make it colourful!

# Ending Note
Resources were just Googling about BSTs. With the exception of the delete function, the process was fairly easy, however the solutions I came up with for deleting wound up being simple in the end. All in all, this was fun as per usual and I'm really starting to **love** Ruby.
